# Milk Quality Prediction Model

## Overview
This machine learning project predicts the quality of milk based on chemical attributes. The model classifies milk as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** quality, offering valuable insights for dairy quality control.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns in milk composition.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data for optimal model input.
- Implemented and compared classification models:
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- Used accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for evaluation.
- Enhanced model performance through feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results
Achieved strong classification accuracy, particularly with the Random Forest model. The predictions provide meaningful categorization of milk quality based on measurable chemical properties.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical application of supervised learning to food quality assessment, contributing to automated quality assurance in the dairy industry.
